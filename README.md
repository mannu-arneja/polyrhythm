* PolyRefrains
* Background and Overview
    * PolyRefrains will visualize the pulses and counterpulses given a time signature. The aim is primarily to be a learning tool to internalize odd-timed, syncopated rhythms, to that end there can be a game aspect that captures keyboard strokes and measures their accuracy.
* Functionality and MVP Features
    * Accepts a range of time signatures
    * preloaded audio samples that generate sequenced beats based on given time signature
    * visualizer with a colorful aesthetic 
    * bonus: drum on the keyboard and try to sync with the two syncopated beats
* Architecture and Technologies
    * Vanilla JS for logic
    * Web Audio API for audio control and syncronization
    * p5.js or paper.js for visuaizations
    * webpack to bundle scripts
    ...
